# Okta FHIR Integration

## INTRODUCTION

This document describes a sample FHIR application, which was developed to provide a template for building an Angular full stack application in a secure manner using an API key.  The application is open source and can be downloaded at: [https://github.com/pjamieso/fhirdemowithapikey](https://github.com/pjamieso/fhirdemowithapikey). The app uses the IRIS FHIR Accelerator Service, a cloud based FHIR service, which is easy to deploy. The FHIR Accelerator Service has many useful features including:

• An Enterprise-grade managed FHIR service easily provisioned and launched on AWS

• Support for FHIR R4

• ISO 27001:2013, supporting HIPAA and GDPR, built on the AWS HITRUST-certified platform

• A development portal for understanding and testing FHIR APIs

• Support for multiple methods of authentication including API Key Authentication, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID connect

• Bulk import of FHIR bundles via S3

• Logging of FHIR request data

Developers can try the service for free by signing up at [https://portal.trial.isccloud.io/account/login](https://portal.trial.isccloud.io/account/login)

The application addresses a practical problem, how to securely retrieve personal health information (PHI), stored in a FHIR server. This demo uses an API key, but a better approach is using OAuth 2.0, a modern security framework enabling distributed authentication and authorization. You can get that demo at [https://github.com/pjamieso/fhirokta]

FHIR INTEGRATION DEMO

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.4. To install use npm install and then npm update.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
